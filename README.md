This project is a Streamlit-based web application for predicting clothing sizes using machine learning models such as RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor. The application takes inputs like weight, age, and height to predict the appropriate clothing size. The project utilizes a CSV dataset containing clothing size information.

Key Features:

Supports multiple machine learning models.
User-friendly interface to input personal data.
Real-time size prediction based on model selection.
The code is designed to be easily deployable on any system, using relative paths to access the dataset, making it convenient for users to run the project on different computers without modifying the file path.
